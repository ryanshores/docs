use pull requests triggers from cloudfront events

or use code pipeline to trigger build

pipeline will build for every merge to main
and
pull request trigger will set requirement for using pull request
	or can we set a rule that main cannot be updated by users
		we can set rule but it would require resetting everyones git permission to use the policy we setup to restrict actions on main branch
	
for setting up the lambda to trigger build on pull request
need a cloudwatch event trigger on pr created and updated
that will trigger the codebuild lambda that gets a version/alias with the correct env variables

for commenting we need another trigger

the starting lambda has additional env params that the result looks for
the rule runs for every build and if the build was started by the lambda than it comments
so we can leave this or chagne it to only run on supported build
